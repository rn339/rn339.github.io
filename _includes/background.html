      I'm currently an undergraduate student at the 
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.njit.edu/" target="_blank">New Jersey Institute of Technology</a> studying 
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://cme.njit.edu/" target="_blank">Chemical Engineering</a> while minoring in 
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://management.njit.edu/minor-business" target="_blank">Business</a>. Additionally, I am working at 
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.anheuser-busch.com/" target="_blank">Anheuser-Busch Companies, LLC</a> at the 
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.anheuser-busch.com/about/breweries-and-tours/newark-nj.html" target="_blank">Newark Brewery</a> as a Packaging Engineer Co-Op. If interested, check out the 
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.budweisertours.com/locations/tours.html" target="_blank">Budweiser Brewery Experience</a> to schedule a tour.
      I want to utilize my skills as a chemical engineer to build a future in clean, sustainable energy. My interests are in process engineering and design to improve
      processes for biofuels, petroleum, and hydrogen-based fuels at commercial scale.

      As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably snowboarding, cruising around on my penny board,
      or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
